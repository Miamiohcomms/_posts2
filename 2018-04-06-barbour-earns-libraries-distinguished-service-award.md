**Heather Barbour**, senior library technician, was honored Thursday as the Miami University Libraries’ 2018 Distinguished Service Award Winner.

One of 15 University Libraries’ staff members nominated by peers for the Distinguished Service Award, Barbour joined the Libraries in 2013\. In her behind-the-scenes role, she helps make Libraries’ print and electronic resources available to the Miami community through a variety of roles ranging from processing and repairing items to collecting data on usage. Barbour also is a fixture on committees planning University Libraries’ staff events as well as on the Libraries’ broomball and curling intramural teams.  

A familiar face on campus, Barbour serves the university as an usher on home football and ice hockey game days.  

The three nominations for Barbour emphasized her uplifting attitude, efforts to build community within the University Libraries staff, and willingness to always pitch in. “Heather makes everyone feel at home and welcomed,” said one nominator. “Her energy is high, her smile infectious, her attitude is always the best. In short she is an excellent ambassador of the Libraries!”  

Dean and University Librarian Jerome Conley, who is in his 25th year of service to the university and University Libraries, also recognized the following:

**- Susan Hurst**, business librarian, for 25 years of service;

**- John Burke**, director of the Gardner Harvey Library, Miami University Middletown, for 15 years of service;

**- Jody Perkins**, digital scholarship librarian, for 15 years of service;

**- Jennifer Smith**, senior library technician, for 15 years of service;

- And **Elias Tzoc** and J**acqueline Johnson** for their appointments to [principal librarian](http://www.lib.miamioh.edu/blog/tzoc-and-johnson-promoted-to-principal-librarian).  

The event drew attention not only to staff service but also to the considerable [creative and scholarly accomplishments](https://lib.miamioh.edu/MUL-Scholarly-Creative-Accomplishments-17-18) the Miami University Libraries team has contributed over the past year.
