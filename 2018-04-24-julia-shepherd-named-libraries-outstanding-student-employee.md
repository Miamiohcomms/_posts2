Senior Julia Shepherd is the recipient of the 2018 Miami University Libraries Outstanding Student Employee of the Year. 

Shepherd, a linguistics and Spanish major from Mason, Ohio, was one of 47 senior or graduate student employees recognized at the Libraries’ annual Student Recognition Dinner Sunday night. During her four years in King Library, she worked at the circulation desk, Center for Information Management, Center for Digital Scholarship and Instructional Materials Center. 

She was presented the honor by Jerome Conley, dean and university librarian; Kris Abney, manager of access and circulation; and Bryan Partner, senior library technician. Her nomination emphasized her passion for library work and her always positive attitude.

“Julia arrived at the Libraries four years ago wanting to be a librarian. She has done everything she can to prepare herself for that goal, including working in four different areas within the University Libraries,” the nomination read. “She has worked overnights, weekends, holidays and numerous breaks with a smile and a great deal of enthusiasm.”

The Outstanding Student Employee of the Year award and Libraries Student Recognition Dinner began two years ago as a way of thanking and recognizing the University Libraries’ senior student employees. Across four campus locations, the University Libraries currently employ more than 100 student workers.

“They are in many ways the faces of the University Libraries, whether connecting patrons with resources from the circulation desk or carrying out behind-the-scenes tasks that keep everything running smoothly,” Conley said. “But they give us so much more than the tasks they perform. They are like family.”

Other featured speakers included Phyllis Callahan, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, and Bradley Mascho ’02 M.A. ’03 a former Libraries student worker who is chief AI officer for NCI.

The full listing of all University Libraries’ student employees who will graduate in spring, summer or fall 2018 is as follows:
