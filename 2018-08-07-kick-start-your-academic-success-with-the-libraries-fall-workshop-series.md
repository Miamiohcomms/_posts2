## Fall workshop series offers tips and tools for scholarly success

The Miami University Libraries have teamed up with the [Rinella Learning Center](https://miamioh.edu/student-life/rinella-learning-center/) and are here to support your scholarly pursuits with a series of nine workshops covering a wide range of topics from [citing sources](https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation) and [navigating copyright law](https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=340133&p=2289652) to mobile apps and [3D printing](https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/3dprinting).

The series kicked off with "Apps for Academic Success" on Wednesday, Aug. 29 and runs through Oct. 10, when it concludes with "Present like a Pro." Pre-registration is available through the Rinella Learning Center, but please feel free to drop by!
