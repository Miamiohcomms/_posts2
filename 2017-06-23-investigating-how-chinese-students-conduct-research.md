The study seeks to explore and better understand the information needs of Chinese patrons, so Librariesâ€™ services can be enhanced to better meet those needs.

The study involves a 30-minute one-on-one interview, and participants have the freedom to stop the interview at any time or skip any question(s) they do not wish to answer. Anonymity is guaranteed, and only the research team will have access to participant responses.

If you would like to participate in this study or have any questions about the study, please contact one of the following librarians:
