[![#MoveInMiami: They unpack. We give back. August 23, 2018\. 20 hours and 22 minutes. 2,022 donors. One amazing day of Love and Honor! MoveInMiami.org](/images/post-images/18_MIM_Header.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOW71UPU-hE)

**The big day is here! **

Regardless of the time and the tool, the heart of our University Libraries remains the same. We reach beyond majors (and the ability to pay) to empower our students with the resources and skills they need to thrive academically and for the rest of their lives.  

We are excited to offer two great initiatives for your #MoveInMiami consideration:  

**[Give to the Libraries Textbook Initiative](https://www.givetomiamioh.org/s/916/16/interior-flah.aspx?sid=916&gid=1&pgid=10874&cid=20230&ecid=20230&crid=0&calpgid=9087&calcid=18947&appealcode=MIM):** Save dozens of students hundreds of dollars each by contributing toward the acquisition of high-demand textbooks to be made available for checkout. Our goal is 50 donors._[Learn about the Textbook Initiative!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIrugGajKNM)_
