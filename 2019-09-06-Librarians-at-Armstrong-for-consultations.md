## Get help with research questions or library resources with in-person help at several locations around campus![Librarians on Location](/images/post-images/LibrariansOnLocation_Logo.png)

_"We're not scary, and we don't bite. We're good at what we do, and we can help you be better at what you do."_

If you:

*   are having trouble finding a source for your paper;
*   aren't sure how to frame your research question;
*   have questions about locating books or journal articles;
*   or just need someone to explain how to properly cite a source,

then we've got great news. A new program beginning this semester makes it easier for you to get assistance from Miami University librarians.

### **Librarians are available for walk-in consultations or questions**  
**Every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday**  
**Noon - 3 p.m.**  
**in the [Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion](https://miamioh.edu/student-life/diversity-affairs/index.html) (CSDI) in Armstrong Student Center.**

All students are welcome, and librarians can assist with questions on any academic subject as well as help with citation, finding sources, using library resources, and more.

Students can also get answers through [a number of other ways](https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/askus), including

*   by [live chat](https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/askus), 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday and 1-8 p.m. on Sundays
