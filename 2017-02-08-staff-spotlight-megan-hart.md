**Where are you originally from? What's your educational background?**  
I am originally from Muncie, Indiana; however, I have lived in Oxford for the past five years. I graduated from Ball State University with an undergraduate degree in general studies, but focused in elementary education and library media and computer education. I am currently studying to get my MLIS and MS in information architecture from Kent State University.

**What's your title? How would you describe your position at the Miami Libraries? (roles/responsibilities as you know them so far)**  
I am a Senior Library Technician at King Library. My job entails desk duties, such as answering patron questions, locating books and articles, directing phone calls to the right extension, as well as many others. I make the schedule for the desk, as well as help clean the computers when there is downtime. 

**What drew you to work in a library environment? Why did you choose the Miami Libraries?**  
I have been working in libraries for the past six years. My previous experiences have been with public libraries, working in both circulation and as a shelver. I have always had a fascination with reading and a passion for learning. The Miami Libraries allow me to stay relatively close to my family and friends, but I have also enjoyed the atmosphere while coming in as a patron.

**What's the best part of working in a library?**  
The best part of working in a library is the constant knowledge adventure. I always refer the process as "having to put my Sherlock hat on." I never know what question I might have to answer. 

**What's one thing you wish college students knew about using a library?**  
Academic and public libraries are different in how they classify their books. If you are looking for a particular author or title and you don’t know the LC call number, you can’t browse the shelves as easily. Please ask for help or use the catalog. 

**What's your favorite book? What book character would you most like to be?**  
My favorite would have to be The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The world building is amazing. I've read this at least once a year since high school. Sabriel, from Garth Nix’s Abhorsen series, would probably be a choice for one of my favorite book characters. I like strong female leads. 

**Any hobbies?**  
My hobbies include the librarian standby of reading (with most selections being young adult), but I also enjoy horseback riding and crafting.

**What's something people don't know about you that might surprise them?**  
I come from a large extended family, where Christmas can end up being over 70 of us there. Family reunions are even larger, with closer to 150\. The great thing is that we all get along well.
