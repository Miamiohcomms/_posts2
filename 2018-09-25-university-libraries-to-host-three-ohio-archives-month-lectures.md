![Ohio Archives Month Lectures Series - Walter Havighurst Special Collections and Archives](/images/post-images/18_Archives-Month_Header.png)

The history of Miami University, Western College for Women and the Oxford community comes alive in October-November, as the Walter Havighurst Special Collections and Archives welcome a trio of Ohio Archives Month lectures to King Library.

Beginning Tuesday, Oct. 9, the annual series seeks to enhance public awareness of archival materials and archival centers through highlighting research and materials with broad appeal. This year's lectures focus on the history of women's baseball at Miami and Western College for Women (Oct. 9), a collection of historic envelopes and letters that cover more than a century of Oxford history (Oct. 25), and longtime Miami professor and historian Walter Havighurst (Nov. 2).

Each of the lectures takes place from noon-1 p.m. in King Library room 320\. Those who cannot attend in-person can view the lectures live or recorded via Facebook Live on the [University Libraries' Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/mulibraries). All lectures are free and open to the public.

Through stories of early college women athletes, the lecture draws important connections between sport, physical activity and gender in higher education.
