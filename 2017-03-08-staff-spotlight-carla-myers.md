_<span style="font-size:13.3333px">Carla Myers joined the University Libraries in January as the Scholarly Communications Coordinator.</span>_

**Where are you originally from? What's your educational background?**  
I grew-up in Huron, Ohio, and then moved to the Akron area for college. I received a B.A. in psychology from the University of Akron and obtained my master’s degree in library and information science from Kent State University. 

**What's your title? How would you describe your position at the Miami Libraries? **  
I'm the coordinator of scholarly communications for the Miami University Libraries. My responsibilities include facilitating the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) on campus, answering questions about U.S. Copyright Law, and helping faculty and students promote their scholarship and research within their professional communities and to the public.

**What drew you to work in a library environment? Why did you choose the Miami Libraries?**  
Growing up, I loved to read. When I went to college, I applied for a job at the campus library, thinking it would be fun to be around so many books. I had intended to become a psychiatrist or physical therapist but quickly fell in love with library work and pursued that path instead. I chose the Miami Libraries because I was so impressed with the passion, dedication and enthusiasm of the library staff and with this beautiful campus.

**What's the best part of working in a library?**  
I love seeing how excited patrons get when you are able to connect them with the information they need, especially when they have a challenging research question. 

**What's one thing you wish college students knew about using a library?**  
Librarians love to be asked questions—ask us anything! We love to connect people with information, whether it's scholarly info for a class project, a topic you're investigating for fun, or directions to a restaurant. I once had a patron ask me about a good gift to give your mother for her birthday...I recommended flowers!

**What's your favorite book? What book character would you most like to be? **  
My favorite book is Eragon, by Christopher Paolini. A book character I admire is Hermione Granger...she's smart and tough.

**Any hobbies? **  
Reading, of course. I also enjoy hiking, biking, and rock climbing.
