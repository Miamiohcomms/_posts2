[![#MoveInMiami: They unpack. We give back. August 23, 2018\. 20 hours and 22 minutes. 2,022 donors. One amazing day of Love and Honor! MoveInMiami.org](/images/post-images/18_MIM_Header.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOW71UPU-hE)

The Miami University Libraries posted another strong showing during the #MoveInMiami day-of-giving campaign, with preliminary numbers showing 70-plus donors contributing more than $9,000 to Libraries' funding priorities.

Processing on the more than 4,400 gifts received during the overall #MoveInMiami effort continues, and the final Libraries total is expected to trend higher. Over the past four years, donors have contributed more than $30,000 to Libraries funds and initiatives during #MoveInMiami.

The bulk of this generosity has been dedicated to the Textbook Initiative, which purchases textbooks for high-enrollment courses and makes them available via checkout to students, and the Technology Support Fund, which enhances the technology resources the Libraries are able to make available to students.

"Each year I'm amazed at the contributions our donors are willing to step up and provide to the University Libraries," said Jerome Conley, dean and university librarian. "We want to provide our students the opportunity to succeed in all their chosen fields of human endeavor, and thanks to your support, we are able to make those dreams come true."
