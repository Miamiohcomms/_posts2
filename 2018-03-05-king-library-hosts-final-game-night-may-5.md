On Saturday, May 5, King Library hosts the Miami University Libraries' final game night of the spring.  

Come by between 6 p.m. - midnight  for free food and the opportunity to join others from the Miami University community as we play strategy / tabletop, board, and card games. The library provides a number of games from its circulating game collection, including recent additions Splendor, Dominion, Mysterium, and Dimension. We offer many of the classics as well.  

You are also invited to bring your own games. These informal events are great for both beginners and experienced players. Just pull up a chair and join in the fun.   

**Students, faculty, staff and families welcome!**
