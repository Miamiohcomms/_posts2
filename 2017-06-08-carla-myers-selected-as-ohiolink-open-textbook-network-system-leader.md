![photo of Carla Myers](/images/post-images/Myers-Carla-O46017.jpg)<span style="font-size:11pt">Carla Myers, Miami University Libraries assistant librarian and coordinator of scholarly communications, has been selected to serve on a statewide</span> taskforce <span style="font-size:11pt">focused on reducing textbook costs for students.</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt">OhioLINK announced Myers as one of eight</span> [<span style="font-size:11pt">Open Textbook Network (OTN) System Leaders</span>](https://www.ohiolink.edu/press/ohiolink_selects_open_textbook_network_system_leaders)<span style="font-size:11pt">, who will be responsible for coordinating OhioLINK OTN awareness and advocacy initiatives regarding open educational resources (OER) and open textbooks. All system leaders were nominated by their deans or directors.</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt">With the cost of textbooks increasing by 73 percent since 2006, this initiative is important for combating rising costs in higher education. Myers, along with her OTN peers, will be participating in the OTN’s Summer Institute (</span>OTNSI<span style="font-size:11pt">) at the University of Minnesota from August 7-11\.</span> OTNSI <span style="font-size:11pt">will prepare OTN staff to coordinate workshops that will focus on developing campus advocates at Ohio higher education institutions who lead  in the effort to reduce textbook costs for students.</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt">System leaders will also assist with affordable learning awareness and advocacy initiatives.</span>

<span style="font-size:11pt">“Textbook and related costs are a well-known barrier to college affordability for students,” said Gwen Evans,</span> OhioLINK <span style="font-size:11pt">executive director. “By promoting the use and creation of high-quality educational materials that are freely accessible for students to use, this initiative will increase affordability in higher education, promote student success, and empower Ohio faculty to contribute to the growing field of open course materials.”</span>
