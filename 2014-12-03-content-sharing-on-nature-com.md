This week, Nature Publishing Group (NPG) introduced new, experimental functionality on the nature.com platform that enables subscribers to many journals at nature.com to share a _read-only_ version of full-text subscription articles, to support collaboration. This functionality is powered by **[ReadCube](https://www.readcube.com/)**, which is an enhanced PDF viewer that can be used in-browser or through the ReadCube client, which is [**available for download**](https://www.readcube.com/download) for both Mac and Windows users.

What does this mean for Miami University Library patrons?

The Libraries subscribe to [**16 journals**](http://goo.gl/PlHdte) on the nature.com platform with the shareable link functionality. If you are a Miami University faculty, student, or staff, you may create a shareable link to an article in one of these 16 journals and share it with anyone, including those outside of the MU community.

To create a shareable link to an article in one of the 16 journal titles, navigate to the full text (html) of an article at the nature.com platform. A Share icon appears just above and to the right of the article title. Click on the Share icon and copy and paste the Shareable Link that appears in the box (e.g., [http://rdcu.be/bK4l](http://rdcu.be/bK4l)). Send this link to colleagues or collaborators who don't have a subscription to the journal but would like to read the article.

For nature.com journal content that is not currently available to Miami University users, colleagues at other institutions who do subscribe to these titles may now send you a shareable link to that content.

Note that these full text articles are not open access, are read-only, and fall under nature.com's **[Principles and Guidelines](http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/content-sharing-policy.html)**.
