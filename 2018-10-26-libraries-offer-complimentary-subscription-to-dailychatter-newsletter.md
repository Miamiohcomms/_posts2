In partnership with Miami University [Global Initiatives](https://miamioh.edu/global-initiatives/index.html), the University Libraries have recently added _[DailyChatter](https://www.dailychatter.com/)_, an international daily email newsletter, to its array of resources offered free of charge to students, faculty and staff.

Miamians can now enjoy a complimentary subscription to the newsletter, which curates some of the most interesting and important global developments and prepares a conversational, easy-to-read report designed to be read on a smartphone or any other digital device. Students, faculty and staff can sign up at [DailyChatter.com/MiamiOH](http://www.dailychatter.com/miamioh) by entering their name and MiamiOH.edu email address, and the newsletter will start arriving the next weekday morning.

Should you decide you don't wish to receive _DailyChatter_ any longer, simply unsubscribe with the link provided at the bottom of every edition.

_DailyChatter_ further enhances the Libraries' free offerings to the Miami community. Students, faculty and staff can also receive free subscriptions to [The New York Times](http://www.lib.miamioh.edu/content/new-york-times) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/blog/libraries-offer-free-access-to-the-wall-street-journal) through the Libraries.
