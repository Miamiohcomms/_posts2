This is a test.

This is the test of the emergency blogcast system.

If this were a real emergency, I hope you weren't going to rely on this doofus to save you.

Now, if we're going to include a pullquote on a page that also has a right-portrait image, I'd really rather they not happen in the same place, so I'm just going to blather on for a little bit.

Let's see if this is long enough. Nope, not long enough yet. Let's give it just a little more...

And lo, it is as the prophets have foretold:

This paragraph is going to have to be long enough to bother with a pullquote. Therefore, it needs to be good and long. It doesn't really have to say anything, but it does have to take its time about it. <span class="pulloutleft">So let's see what we can do about that.</span> It doesn't take much, does it? And that is really the whole point.
