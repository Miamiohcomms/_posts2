_An Ohio native, Lindsey Masters joined the Miami University Libraries last month as a senior library technician in the Center for Digital Scholarship._

**Where are you originally from? What's your educational background?**  
Originally, I am from Millersburg, Ohio; more commonly known as Amish Country. I graduated from the University of Mount Union, where I studied Japanese language and Media Computing. During my time at Mount I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Japan for a semester.

**What drew you to work in a library environment? Why did you choose the Miami University Libraries?**  
While studying at Mount, I spent time working at the campus library. During that time, I found the atmosphere and work environment of an academic library to be one that was very welcoming and enjoyable. While researching Miami, I found the libraries here have that same atmosphere, as well as a team that has a real passion for its work. The campus and its libraries seemed genuine about wanting to provide the best resources and opportunities for their students and staff, and that was something I wanted to be a part of.

**What's the best part of working in a library?**  
The best part about working in a library is easy access to books. I like to peruse the shelves when I have extra time during lunch. It’s always fun to find something new you might not have known was there before.

**What's one thing you wish college students knew about using a library?**  
I hope students realize the library is so much more than just a quiet place to study. It’s great for that, but there is so much more available to them—help with writing, research tools, technology, an extremely helpful and friendly staff. There are a lot of resources they can take advantage of.

**What's your favorite book? What book character would you most like to be?**  
“Howl’s Moving Castle,” by Diana Wynne Jones, has been my favorite book since I was about nine years old. I’ve probably reread it more times than I should. I would definitely choose to be the main character, Sophie. She becomes cursed, is transformed into an 80-plus year old woman, makes a deal with a fire demon, and gets into the middle of all sorts of mischief and magical adventures, all the while crankily complaining about her aching bones.

**Any hobbies?**  
I enjoy reading (big surprise!), but also enjoy creative writing, as well as illustration and crafting.

**What's something people don't know about you that might surprise them?**  
I love to quilt. I’ve quilted about eight blankets in the past two years and have two works-in-progress waiting for me to get around to finishing them.
