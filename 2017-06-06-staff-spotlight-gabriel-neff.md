_Gabriel Neff joined the Miami University Libraries in November 2016 as a library technician and the evening circulation desk supervisor at King Library. He grew up in Cincinnati, graduated from Northern Kentucky University and began working in the library environment as a student worker during his college days._

**Where are you originally from? What's your educational background?**

I grew up in Mason, Ohio. After attending Archbishop Moeller High School, I was a student-athlete (football) at Seton Hill University for two years. I hold a B.A. in organizational leadership from Northern Kentucky University.

**What's your title? How would you describe your position at the Miami Libraries? **

I am a library technician as well as the evening Circulation desk supervisor. I help ensure that everyone who comes to the circulation desk has a positive experience as well as connecting students to the resources they need. 

**What drew you to work in a library environment? Why did you choose the Miami Libraries?**

I first started working in libraries as a student employee at NKU. I found that I liked helping my fellow students and enjoyed the benefits of working on campus. I ended up completing my internship at NKU's Steely Library, working primarily in circulation and stack maintenance. A couple years later I moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, with a former college roommate and started working at West Virginia University. I was at WVU for two years, working in facilities management and residential education. Miami's excellent reputation as an academic institution, competitive pay and benefits, as well as the opportunity to come back home to Southwestern Ohio were all major factors in choosing the Miami University Libraries.

**What's the best part of working in a library?**  
Being involved in the Miami community, helping students, patrons and guests. 

**What's one thing you wish college students knew about using a library?**  
That library staff is always there to support them in any way. Never hesitate to ask for help.

**What's your favorite book? **  
"The Mind's Eye" by Oliver Sacks

**Any hobbies?**  
Spending time with my fiancée. Hanging out with family around Oxford. Playing on the Libraries' broom ball team. Watching Bengals, Reds, Blue Jackets, Miami and WVU games. 

**What's something people don't know about you that might surprise them?**  
I played the clarinet and viola as a kid.
