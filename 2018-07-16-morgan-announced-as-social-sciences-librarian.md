The Miami University Libraries are pleased to welcome Abi Morgan to the Advise & Instruct Department, where she began as social sciences librarian on July 2.

Morgan provides library services including consultation, instruction and collection development for faculty and students in social sciences departments across the College of Education, Health, and Society; the Farmer School of Business; and the College of Arts and Sciences.

"We're excited to be able to position the library to provide additional subject specialist capacity for the Farmer School of Business as well as the Department of Teacher Education," said Kevin Messner, head of Advise & Instruct.

Morgan holds a bachelor's in history and anthropology from Ohio University, a master's in library and information science from the University of Maryland, College Park and a master's in adolescent and young adult education from Ohio University. She most recently served as senior library technician at Miami's Wertz Art & Architecture Library since July 2017.

Prior to joining Miami, Morgan worked as librarian and project manager with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and served as interim Upper School library assistant at Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. She also taught World Studies and U.S. History as a long-term substitute at Miller High School.

"Abi has a terrific breadth of experience in the applied social sciences between her classroom experience in middle and high school teaching and her prior role as a federal government librarian. It is a bonus that she starts her new role already acquainted with Miami and the library system," said Messner.

"This role is a wonderful opportunity to utilize all my previous work experiences and enhance my connections with the great library team at Miami. I'm excited to spend more time on instruction and to collaborate with students, faculty and staff on their research," said Morgan.

Morgan works out of B.E.S.T. Library in 219E Laws Hall and can be reached at [morgan55@miamioh.edu](mailto:morgan55@miamioh.edu) or 529-2789.
