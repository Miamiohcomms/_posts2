![Open Access Week 2018 - Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge - October 22 to 28](/images/post-images/open-access-week-2018-banner.png)

The Miami University Libraries invite you to celebrate Open Access Week 2018\. Celebrated Oct. 22-28, Open Access Week promotes the creation and use of resources made accessible through the open sharing of research, scholarship and data.

You can learn more about Open Access during one of these events:

**Wednesday, Oct. 24**

**Advocacy for Scholarly Communication**

10-11 a.m.

King Library Lobby

Scholarly Communications is increasingly important to academic institutions, and this session offers a basic exploration of the issues and how they impact libraries.

**Friday, Oct. 26**

**Film Screening**

King 320

1:30-3:30 p.m.

Join us for a screening of the film [Paywall: The Business of Scholarship](https://paywallthemovie.com/), which explores the need for open access to research and science, and questions the rationale behind for-profit academic publishers and their $25.2 billion in annual profits. A facilitated discussion follows the screening, and refreshments will be served.

Questions about any of the University Libraries' Open Access Week events can be directed to [Carla Myers](mailto:myersc2@miamioh.edu), coordinator of scholarly communications, or [Jennifer Bazeley](mailto:bazelejw@miamioh.edu), coordinator of collection access & acquisitions.

### What is Open Access, and how do the Libraries support it?

_Guest blog post by Jody Perkins, digital scholarship librarian and metadata specialist_

According to SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) "Open Access (OA) is the free, immediate, online availability of research articles, coupled with the rights to use these articles fully in the digital environment." Providing OA to research is achieved primarily via deposit of a preprint to an OA repository or through publication in an OA journal. OA journals are a rapidly growing segment of the scholarly publishing market covering research in nearly every discipline. Content is openly available without most of the financial or copyright restrictions of traditional publications.

_The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) currently includes entries for:_

*   **12,187** Journals
*   **3,424,818** Articles

OA publishing can provide researchers with exposure to a large international audience that is beyond the scope of any single subscription based journal, increasing the impact of their work and advancing scholarship while also raising the research profile of the university. It also has the potential to provide students with unrestricted access to resources for their own research beyond the constraints of shrinking library budgets. In addition, it gives citizens timely access to research that was funded in whole or in part through tax dollars and which may also help community groups address pressing local issues.

**_How to get involved:_**

*   Sponsor an OA-related event in your department
*   Publish your research in an OA Journal
*   Deposit a copy of your research article or dataset in an OA repository
*   Start or sponsor an OA Journal
*   Schedule a consultation with a librarian in the Center for Digital Scholarship

_The Center for Digital Scholarship_ at Miami University helps faculty and students collect, preserve and provide access to the intellectual output of the Miami University community as well as assist them with fair use and copyright retention. The Scholarly Commons repository includes faculty research articles, technical reports, honors theses and conference papers and proceedings. CDS can also assist faculty in developing and publishing open access e-books using open e-book standards like epub and mobi. Additionally, CDS can host, setup and manage an open access scholarly journal, with or without peer review, using the Open Journal system.
