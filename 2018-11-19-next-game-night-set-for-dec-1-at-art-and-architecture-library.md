### _4 reasons you should check out a Libraries Game Night_

The University Libraries are opening up the games collection and supplying free food for five Library Game Nights this fall. Join in the fun with your fellow Miamians and choose from a large variety of board, tabletop, and card games from classic to contemporary. No experience is required, and all students, faculty, staff and families are welcome.

The schedule of remaining Game Nights follows:

**Saturday, Dec. 1 - 6-10 p.m.**  
_Wertz Art & Architecture Library (Alumni Hall)_

In case you need convincing, here are four reasons to check out a Library Game Night:

1.  **Game Nights travel to each Miami University library**  
    Miami University is home to four library locations, all with their unique features and specialties. As you visit for a Game Night, you might end up finding your new favorite study spot.
2.  **There's great - and free - food**  
    Every proper game night features great food, and the Libraries' Game Nights are no exception. To fuel your gaming session, we're providing a variety of free food and snacks.
3.  **Everyone's welcome**  
    These laid-back events are great for both beginners and experienced players - just pull up a chair and join the fun. Libraries staff will be happy to help set up and explain games.
4.  **You can continue the fun after the night is over**  
    If you find your new favorite game at a Game Night, chances are you can check it out from the Library. The Instructional Materials Center (IMC) in King Library maintains a collection of games available for checkout.
