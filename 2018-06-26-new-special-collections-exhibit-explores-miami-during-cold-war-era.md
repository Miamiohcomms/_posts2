From the threat of nuclear war to Korea and Vietnam to unrest on campus, the Cold War years marked a notable and turbulent time in Miami University history.

A new exhibit in the Walter Havighurst Special Collections & University Archives, located in King Library 321, explores the various chapters and sides of this era through photos, letters, memorabilia and even a children's game.

In this three-minute video, Elizabeth Maurer, library technician in the Havighurst Special Collections & University Archives, introduces "We Were There: Miami in the Cold War" and talks about a few notable items and their place in Miami history.

_"We Were There: Miami in the Cold War" is available for viewing - free of charge - in King Library room 321\. The Havighurst Special Collections and University Archives are open 8 a.m. - 4 p.m., Monday-Friday._
