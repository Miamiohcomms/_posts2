For the past few months, a team of librarians has worked hard to create a new website for Miami University's Libraries. Their goal is to "proactively connect our community with the resources and personalized guidance to empower discovery, creation and success." The content and design evolve on a daily basis as the web services librarians adjust and refine the site, but now the team requests feedback from the Miami community: meaning you!

## Visiting the beta site

1.  **Visit** the beta website through the link at the top of [current Libraries website](https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/), or head [straight to the beta site](https://beta.lib.miamioh.edu/beta/) at [beta.lib.miamioh.edu](http://beta.lib.miamioh.edu)

2.  **Explore** the new website: Can you find what you need? Do you like the look and feel?

3.  **Send us feedback** via the form on the [welcome page](https://beta.lib.miamioh.edu/beta/)

Be honest! The more issues we identify today, the better the website becomes for full-time use in the spring of 2020.

## A quick tour

_Please note: the website is a work in progress. Numerous links lead back to our current site._

The new website aims to give you fast and easy access to all our services and resources.

**Navigation** -- Our new navigation menu above is split into three sections:

*   **Research & Support** covers everything you can find and do at the Libraries.
*   **Using the libraries** contains information on how to use our services and resources.
*   **About** gives information about our locations and organization.

**OneSearch box**: On [our new homepage](https://beta.lib.miamioh.edu/), you'll see OneSearch, which searches our in-library materials and online resources all at once. The tabs on the left also allow you to jump straight to article or book searches. Links below the search boxes feature additional resources and advanced options. You can still search articles, books, or our website on their own in tabs below OneSearch.

**It's all happening at the Libraries**: Our [new front page](https://beta.lib.miamioh.edu/) showcases our resources, services, news, exhibits, collections and events.

**Chat with us**: Click the "Ask Us" button on the right side of any page to chat with a real librarian.

**New content throughout**: Our new [A-Z list of databases](https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az.php) lets you focus on your subject of study. Our new [Makerspace and labs](https://create.lib.miamioh.edu/) give you new ways to create and innovate.

**Additional functionality**: Studying for finals? Not sure if a computer will be free when you get to a library? No problem: check the website or use the mobile [LabFind app](https://beta.lib.miamioh.edu/technology/computer-labs/) for a live count of free computers and specialty software available on them at libraries all over campus. 

## The story doesn't end here

In the coming months, the Libraries will recruit students for testing and in-person interviews to make sure the website meets the needs of the Miami students. The team is working to create customizable options that proactively connect users to the Libraries' resources. Visit, explore and send feedback throughout the whole process, start now through the link below.
