Library Game Nights are back by popular demand for the fall semester with a set of four free events open to all this September through November.

For Library Game Nights, the University Libraries open up an extensive collection of board, tabletop, and strategy games and provide food and refreshments - essential ingredients to any good game night. All experience and skill levels are invited, and participants are welcome to bring their own favorite games to play.

Game Nights travel to each of the four Oxford campus libraries and typically draw about 100 participants, making them great opportunities for meeting new people.

The full schedule of fall semester game nights follows:
