With a renewed focus on connecting with new students and bolstering support of other key student constituencies, the Miami University Libraries are excited to announce the hiring of two new student success librarians within the Advise & Instruct Department.

Laura Birkenhauer, a 2010 Miami alumna who began with the University Libraries in 2011, assumes the role of student success librarian for campus engagement. Nate Floyd, an academic resident librarian at Miami since 2017 continues his Miami Libraries' tenure as student success librarian for foundational learning. Both began their new roles on June 1.

"The emphasis on student success and engagement is not new to the University Libraries," said Lindsay Miller, assistant head of Advise & Instruct. "These new positions increase our capacity to create meaningful, welcoming and supportive experiences for students engaging with Miami's library services and resources. Their voices also will represent the Libraries in campus-wide discussions about student success."

As student success librarian for campus engagement, Birkenhauer supports students via classroom instruction, workshops, events and other initiatives. She will collaborate closely with campus partners to enhance student engagement, success and academic well-being. The role seeks to enhance outreach to key campus constituencies, including first-generation students, international students, veterans and others.

Birkenhauer holds a bachelor's from Miami and an M.L.I.S. from Kent State University. She joined the University Libraries as a senior library technician in 2011 and has served as academic resident librarian since October 2016\. Much of her residency was dedicated to providing instruction, developing innovative programming and fostering campus partnerships to better serve first-year and at-risk student populations.

"Laura has already demonstrated her ability to thrive in this role," Miller said. "She brings high levels of professionalism and enthusiasm to the position, and we are excited both by the ideas she brings to the table and her demonstrated ability to turn great ideas into realities."

Birkenhauer works out of 214 King Library and can be reached at [crosbylm@MiamiOH.edu](mailto:crosbylm@MiamiOH.edu) or 529-4148.

As student success librarian for foundational learning, Floyd supports the student transition from high school to college with a focus on integrating research skills and information literacy into the first-year student curriculum. He will also build upon programming and services that orient students to the University Libraries and engage them as active users of library resources.

Floyd holds bachelor's and master's degrees from Marshall University, an M.L.S. from Indiana University, and is nearing completion of a doctorate in mass communication from IU. For the past year, he has served the Miami Libraries by developing instructional sessions in information and media literacy.

"Nate's interest, experience and enthusiasm make him a great addition," Miller said. "His background in information literacy and journalism allow him to introduce and instill these skills to students in interactive and engaging ways. He has been impressive in the ways he has been able to keep up with and adapt to how changes in technology are reshaping this landscape."

Floyd works out of 215 King Library and can be reached at [floydns@MiamiOH.edu](mailto:floydns@MiamiOH.edu) or 529-4187.

"We are excited about these hires and the directions in which they will lead the futures of the Miami University Libraries and the Advise & Instruct department," said Kevin Messner, head, Advise & Instruct. "Nate and Laura both offer insightful perspectives and direct experience in relation to student needs in and outside the classroom. Their roles and their abilities will actively build and contribute to Libraries' and university programming."
